  challenge: 'A rapidly scaling government contracting intelligence firm approached Kenosa Consulting with an ambitious request: build a sophisticated demonstration of AI-powered opportunity matching that could process contractor capability statements and intelligently match them against a database of federal opportunities. The catch? They needed it in 72 hours for a critical board presentation.',
  solution: 'Kenosa architected a modern, scalable solution leveraging React 18 with TypeScript, Node.js + Express, and Google Gemini AI. We built an intelligent data ingestion pipeline processing multiple heterogeneous data sources, implemented AI-powered capability extraction with 95%+ accuracy, and created a three-tier matching algorithm with thematic synthesis.',
  results: [
    'Board approval secured with immediate funding',
    'Moved to production within 1 week with full dev team assigned',
    'Reduced opportunity analysis time from 10 hours to 2 minutes',
    '5x increase in relevant opportunities identified',
    'Projected 30% improvement in proposal success rate',
    '200% return on investment within 6 months'
