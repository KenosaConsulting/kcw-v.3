3. AI analysis runs at key steps
4. Final submission triggers:
   - Complete analysis
   - SOW generation
   - Data persistence

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Without API Key
The system includes fallback local analysis that works without Gemini API:
- Basic completeness scoring
- Rule-based risk assessment
- Standard follow-up questions

### Test With API Key
With Gemini configured, you get:
- Advanced AI analysis
- Contextual suggestions
- Intelligent risk assessment
- Dynamic follow-up questions

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API key is only used client-side (for demo purposes)
- In production, move API calls to backend
- Session data stored in localStorage
- No sensitive data transmitted without user consent

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key not configured"
- Check `.env.local` has correct key
- Restart dev server after adding key
- Verify key is active in Google Console

### Form data not persisting
- Check localStorage is enabled
- Session saves automatically every change
- Data persists for current session only

### Analysis not running
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check browser console for errors
- System falls back to local analysis if API fails

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Move AI calls to server-side
2. **Database Storage**: Persist submissions to database
3. **Email Notifications**: Send alerts on submission
4. **Admin Dashboard**: View and manage submissions
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Track conversion metrics
