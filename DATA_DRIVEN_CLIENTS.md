# Data-Driven Clients Page Implementation

## Overview
The Clients page is now fully data-driven, making it much easier to maintain and update client information. All client data lives in a single source of truth file.

## Architecture

### Files Structure
```
kcw-v.3-main/
├── data/
│   └── clients.ts         # Single source of truth for all client data
├── types/
│   └── client.ts          # TypeScript interface for Client
└── pages/
    └── ClientsPage.tsx    # Component that renders from data
```

## How to Update Client Information

### 1. Edit Client Data
To update any client information (description, industry, services, etc.), only edit `/data/clients.ts`:

```typescript
// Example: Update a client's description
{
  slug: "navancio",
  name: "Navancio",
  description: "NEW DESCRIPTION HERE", // <- Just edit this line
  industry: "Federal IT & Cybersecurity",
  services: ["Market intelligence", "Competitive analysis"]
}
```

### 2. Add a New Client
Simply add a new object to the CLIENTS array in `/data/clients.ts`:

```typescript
{
  slug: "new-client",
  name: "New Client Name",
  logoSrc: "/client-logos/new-client.png",
  description: "Client description...",
  industry: "Industry Name",
  services: ["Service 1", "Service 2"],
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"] // optional
}
```

### 3. Remove a Client
Delete the client object from the CLIENTS array in `/data/clients.ts`.

### 4. Reorder Clients
Simply reorder the objects in the CLIENTS array - the page will render them in that order.

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: All client data in one file
✅ **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures all required fields are present
✅ **Easy Updates**: No need to touch UI components for content changes
✅ **Reusable**: Same data can be used for other pages, SEO, sitemaps, etc.
✅ **Future-Ready**: Can easily swap to a CMS or API later
✅ **Clean Diffs**: Content changes are easy to review in Git
✅ **Consistent**: Enforces same fields for every client

## Adding Client Logos

Place logo files in `/public/client-logos/` and reference them in the data file:
```typescript
logoSrc: "/client-logos/client-name.png"
```

## Available Fields

Each client object has these fields:
- `slug`: URL-friendly identifier
- `name`: Display name
- `logoSrc`: Path to logo file
- `website`: (optional) Client website URL
- `description`: Brief description
- `industry`: Industry/sector
- `services`: Array of services provided
- `tags`: (optional) Array of tags for filtering/search

## Future Enhancements

This structure makes it easy to add:
- Case study links
- Contract vehicles
- Project highlights
- Client testimonials
- Revenue/employee data
- Location information
- Partnership duration

Just add new fields to the Client interface and data!
