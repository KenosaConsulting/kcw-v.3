# Case Studies Makeover - QA & Rollout Checklist

## ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

### 1. File Structure Verification
- [x] `/data/case-studies.ts` - Created with 11 case studies
- [x] `/components/case-studies/KPI.tsx` - KPI component created
- [x] `/components/case-studies/CaseStudyPage.tsx` - Main page component created  
- [x] `/pages/case-studies/[slug].tsx` - Dynamic route created
- [x] `/pages/case-studies/index.tsx` - Listing page created
- [x] `/styles/case-studies.css` - Optional utilities created

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
- [ ] Verify TS path aliases support `@/data` and `@/components`
- [ ] Check `tsconfig.json` includes:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "paths": {
        "@/*": ["./*"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Navigation Updates
- [ ] Update main navigation to link to `/case-studies`
- [ ] Update any existing case study links to use new routes
- [ ] Set up redirects from old case study URLs (if applicable)

### 4. Content Verification (Mission-Critical)
- [ ] **Case 3 (ERC Market Intelligence)**: Verify "Justified $250 Million+ marketing expansion" appears in impact ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Case 4 (ProposalGPT)**: Verify 70,000+ contacts in both KPI and Impact sections ‚úÖ
- [ ] All 11 case studies are accessible via their slugs
- [ ] SEO meta descriptions are present and within 120-155 chars

### 5. Visual QA (Test at these breakpoints)
- [ ] **Desktop (1440px)**: Full 4-column KPI layout
- [ ] **Laptop (1280px)**: Comfortable spacing, readable prose
- [ ] **Tablet (834px)**: KPIs wrap to 2 columns gracefully
- [ ] **Mobile (390px)**: Single column, proper padding

### 6. Typography Checks
- [ ] Headlines use `font-serif` with proper tracking
- [ ] No descenders are clipped on headlines
- [ ] `leading-tight` on H1 elements
- [ ] Prose sections have comfortable reading rhythm

### 7. Accessibility Audit
- [ ] Each page has exactly one H1 tag
- [ ] H2 tags follow in logical order
- [ ] All links have discernible names
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] CTA buttons have sufficient contrast (amber-600 on white)

### 8. CSS Integration
- [ ] Import case-studies.css in your global CSS file:
  ```css
  @import "./styles/case-studies.css";
  ```
- [ ] Or add the content directly to your existing Tailwind CSS file

### 9. Analytics Setup (Optional)
- [ ] Add event tracking to CTA buttons
- [ ] Track page views for individual case studies
- [ ] Monitor engagement metrics

### 10. Performance Checks
- [ ] Static generation working for all case study pages
- [ ] Images optimized (if adding hero images later)
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable

### 11. Testing Checklist

#### Functional Tests
- [ ] All 11 case study detail pages load correctly
- [ ] Listing page shows all case studies
- [ ] CTA buttons link to `/contact` (or specified href)
- [ ] Navigation between case studies works
- [ ] 404 handling for non-existent slugs

#### Content Tests
- [ ] KPI values display correctly
- [ ] All sections render (Challenge, Build, Impact, Narrative, How It Works)
- [ ] Optional tech field only shows when present
- [ ] Tags render correctly (if displayed)

#### Responsive Tests
- [ ] Test on real devices (iPhone, iPad, Android)
- [ ] Check landscape orientation on mobile
- [ ] Verify touch targets are 44x44px minimum

### 12. Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- [ ] Check for TypeScript errors
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Test production build locally

### 13. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Verify all routes work in production
- [ ] Check meta tags with social media debuggers
- [ ] Monitor for any errors in production

### 14. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all case studies are indexed by search engines
- [ ] Submit sitemap if needed
- [ ] Monitor analytics for proper tracking
- [ ] Gather team feedback

## üîÑ Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Keep old case study components as backups in `/components/casestudy/` 
2. Old data files remain in `/data/caseStudiesData.ts` and `/data/detailedCaseStudies.ts`
3. Can revert by updating imports and routes

## üìù Notes
- This implementation is drop-in compatible with Next.js page router
- Minimal risk as it creates new paths rather than overwriting existing ones
- All content is code-driven (no CMS dependencies)
- SEO-optimized with proper meta tags

## üöÄ Quick Test URLs
After implementation, test these routes:
- `/case-studies` - Listing page
- `/case-studies/capturegpt-72-hour-demo` - First case study
- `/case-studies/erc-market-intelligence-growth-strategy` - Case with $250M+ mention
- `/case-studies/proposalgpt-leadgen-marketing-intelligence` - Case with 70k+ contacts

## üí° Future Enhancements
- Add hero images for each case study
- Implement related case studies section
- Add filtering/search on listing page
- Create PDF export functionality
- Add social sharing buttons
