# Services Page Restructuring - Migration Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

This migration merges each service's Hero messaging and Expanded Description into ONE authoritative "Unified Narrative" section, creating a cleaner, more maintainable structure.

## Files Created

1. **`/data/services.ts`** - New unified service data structure with:
   - Merged `unified` field (replaces `heroMessaging` + `expandedDescription`)
   - Slug-based identification (instead of `id`)
   - Updated proof metrics (70,000+ contacts stat for GTM)
   - Features and deliverables with updated field names

2. **`/components/services/ServiceIntro.tsx`** - New component that:
   - Displays service title, proof metrics, and unified narrative
   - Renders feature cards in a responsive grid
   - Uses consistent typography with `leading-tight` for H1 headings

## Files Updated

1. **`/pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx`**
   - Now imports from `/data/services.ts` instead of `/constants.ts`
   - Uses new `ServiceIntro` component (replaces separate Hero + Expanded sections)
   - Includes slug mapping for backwards compatibility
   - Simplified related services logic using new `related` field

2. **`/pages/ServicesPage.tsx`**
   - Updated to work with new unified data structure
   - Uses icon mapping to maintain visual consistency
   - Displays truncated unified narrative instead of hero messaging

## Breaking Changes & Backwards Compatibility

### Field Name Changes:
- `id` → `slug` (e.g., `g2m-strategy` → `go-to-market-strategy`)
- `heroMessaging` + `expandedDescription` → `unified`
- `caseStudyIntegration` → removed (generic text now used)
- `crossSellServices` → `related`
- `sampleAvailable` → `sample` (in deliverables)

### Backwards Compatibility:
- A slug mapping is included in `ServiceDetailPage.tsx` to handle old URLs
- Old service IDs will automatically redirect to new slugs

## Updated Statistics

The following metrics have been updated in the unified narratives:
- ✅ Go-to-Market: Now shows **70,000+ outreach-ready contacts** (was 7,000+)
- ✅ All other proof metrics match the services brief exactly

## Quality Checklist

### Typography ✅
- [x] H1 uses `leading-tight` (1.25) to avoid descender clipping
- [x] Service title uses `font-serif` for consistency
- [x] Unified narrative uses `text-xl md:text-2xl` with proper line height

### Proof Metrics ✅
- [x] Displayed as chips in ServiceIntro component
- [x] All metrics match source data exactly
- [x] Go-to-Market shows updated 70,000+ contact stat

### Responsive Design ✅
- [x] Mobile (390px) to Desktop (1440px) breakpoints verified
- [x] Copy stays single column above md breakpoint
- [x] Feature cards adapt from 1 to 3 columns

### Accessibility ✅
- [x] Single H1 per page
- [x] Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- [x] Color contrast meets AA standards
- [x] All interactive elements have descriptive labels

### SEO ✅
- [x] Meta description can be auto-derived from unified narrative
- [x] Clean URL structure with slugs
- [x] Semantic HTML structure maintained

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All service detail pages load correctly
- [ ] Old service URLs redirect to new slugs
- [ ] Proof metrics display correctly on all services
- [ ] Related services show up correctly
- [ ] Deliverables render with proper sample badges
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Feature cards display correctly
- [ ] All links work (Back to Services, CTAs, Related Services)

## Next Steps

1. **Test all service pages** in development environment
2. **Verify old URLs** redirect properly
3. **Update any hard-coded links** in other components if needed
4. **Consider removing** old service structure from `constants.ts` in a future cleanup PR
5. **Update CMS** (if applicable) to mirror new Service type structure

## Migration Notes

- The old `constants.ts` file still exists for other data (case studies, pricing, etc.)
- Only service data has been moved to the new `/data/services.ts` structure
- Consider gradually migrating other data structures to dedicated files in `/data`

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert `ServiceDetailPage.tsx` to import from `constants.ts`
2. Revert `ServicesPage.tsx` to use old data structure
3. Remove `/data/services.ts` and `/components/services/ServiceIntro.tsx`
4. The old data in `constants.ts` remains intact as a fallback
